Definitions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.</em></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the \"Terms\") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at <a href=\"https://github.com/site/privacy\">github.com/site/privacy</a>) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at <a href=\"/categories/site-policy/\">help.github.com/categories/site-policy</a>.</li>\n<li>The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub.</li>\n<li>The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at <a href=\"https://github.com/\">github.com</a>, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as <a href=\"https://education.github.com/\">education.github.com</a> and <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">pages.github.com</a>. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as <a href=\"https://githubuniverse.com/\">githubuniverse.com</a>, and product websites, such as <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">atom.io</a>. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.</li>\n<li>“The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See <a href=\"#5-additional-terms\">Section B(5): Additional Terms</a>).</li>\n<li>“GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.</li>\n<li>“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. \"Content\" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. \"Your Content\" is Content that you create or own.</li>\n<li>An \"Account\" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “User Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>\n<a id=\"b-account-terms\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#b-account-terms\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>B. Account Terms</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>User Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.</em></p>\n\n<h4>\n<a id=\"1-account-controls\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-account-controls\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>1. Account Controls</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Organizations. The \"owner\" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one User Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>\n<a id=\"2-required-information\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-required-information\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>2. Required Information</h4>\n\n<p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a <a href=\"#l-payment\">paid Account</a>, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</p>\n\n<h4>\n<a id=\"3-account-requirements\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-account-requirements\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>3. Account Requirements</h4>\n\n<p>We have a few simple rules for User Accounts on GitHub's Service.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by \"bots\" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:<br>\n</li>\n<li>A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free User Account.</li>\n<li>One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).</li>\n<li>You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will <a href=\"#m-cancellation-and-termination\">terminate that User’s Account immediately</a>. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.</li>\n<li>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization  may only provide access to as many User Accounts as your subscription allows.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>\n<a id=\"4-user-account-security\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-user-account-security\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>4. User Account Security</h4>\n\n<p>You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).</li>\n<li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>\n<li>You will promptly <a href=\"https://github.com/contact\">notify GitHub</a> if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>\n<a id=\"5-additional-terms\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-additional-terms\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>5. Additional Terms</h4>\n\n<p>In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this <a href=\"/articles/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-u-s-federal-government-users/\">Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service</a> applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.</p>\n\n<p>If you have signed up for GitHub Business Cloud, the <a href=\"/articles/github-business-cloud-addendum/\">Business Cloud Addendum</a> applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.</p>\n\n<h3>\n<a id=\"c-acceptable-use\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#c-acceptable-use\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>C. Acceptable Use</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.</em></p>\n\n<h4>\n<a id=\"1-compliance-with-laws-and-regulations\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-compliance-with-laws-and-regulations\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>1.

Services Usage Limits</h4>\n\n<p>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without GitHub's express written permission.</p>\n\n<h4>\n<a id=\"5-scraping\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-scraping\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>5. Scraping</h4>\n\n<p>Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through GitHub's API. Please see <a href=\"#h-api-terms\">Section H</a> for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from GitHub for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.</li>\n<li>Archivists may scrape GitHub for public data for archival purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may not scrape GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.</p>\n\n<p>All use of GitHub data gathered through scraping must comply with the <a href=\"https://github.com/site/privacy\">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>\n<a id=\"6-privacy\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#6-privacy\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>6. Privacy</h4>\n\n<p>Misuse of GitHub Users' Personal Information is prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>Any person, entity, or service collecting data from GitHub must comply with the <a href=\"https://github.com/site/privacy\">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement).

These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.</p>\n\n<h4>\n<a id=\"4-license-grant-to-us\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-license-grant-to-us\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>4.

By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and \"fork\" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).</p>\n\n<p>If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you <a href=\"/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository\">adopt a license</a>.

If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.</p>\n\n<p>Isn't this just how it works already?

However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.</p>\n\n<h3>\n<a id=\"e-private-repositories\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#e-private-repositories\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>E.
